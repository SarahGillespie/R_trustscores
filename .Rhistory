# setting up the Python environment and bringing in the required Python packages is important.
# It will probably take a little while so be patient and try to avoid accidentally running
# this chunk of code.
# common trouble shooting:
# if you're missing a package then try adding its name in an additonal line of py_install
# if py_install isn't working then try adding the pip = TRUE argument to try installing
# the library through pip rather than anaconda
