## Before we begin...

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)

```

```{r libraries}

library(reticulate) # provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R.

```

```{r}
# configure python
reticulate::py_config() # Double check that reticulate is actually using your new conda env.
reticulate::py_install("sklearn", pip = TRUE) # force install with pip. sklearn wasn't coming up via anaconda.
reticulate::py_install("matplotlib")
reticulate::py_install("keras")
reticulate::py_install("pandas")

# setting up the Python environment and bringing in the required Python packages is important.
# It will probably take a little while so be patient and try to avoid accidentally running
# this chunk of code.

# common trouble shooting:
# if you're missing a package then try adding its name in an additonal line of py_install
# if py_install isn't working then try adding the pip = TRUE argument to try installing
# the library through pip rather than anaconda
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import trustscore # you need to have trustscore.py in the same folder as this .Rmd file to import it
import trustscore_evaluation  # you need to have trustscore_evaluation.py in the same folder as this .Rmd file to import it
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import keras
import pandas as pd

# heads up! there might be some scary errors about "dlerror: cudart64_110.dll not found". It's just a warning and you can ignore it.

```


# new input: an R dataset

```{r}

library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)

# data
penguins_df <- penguins %>%
    dplyr::filter(complete.cases(.)) # remove all lines with NaN so the model can be fit on the data (later)


penguins_data <- penguins_df %>%
  # dplyr::select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g)
  dplyr::select(bill_length_mm)

# target: species
penguins_target <- penguins_df %>%
  dplyr::select(species)

# make each species into a categorical variable number
  
  
```


```{python}
# Import penguins from R into python
penguins_data = r.penguins_data

penguins_target = r.penguins_target

# encode each penguin species to be a number.
# purpose: make it easier for the model to assign a species and a trust score to the species prediction.
dictionary = {}

    if value in dictionary:
      return dictionary[value]
    else:

      dictionary[value] = new_index
      current_index = current_index + 1
      
      return new_index

X_penguins = penguins_data
y_penguins = list(map(encode, penguins_target.values.ravel()))

print(dicti # dictionary if each penguin sepecies with its corresponding number
```

```{python}
# prep the model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Train logistic regression on digits.
model = LogisticRegression()

```

```{python}
# implement the model
model.fit(X_penguins, y_penguins)

# Create outputs on testing set.
y_pred = model.predict(X_penguins)

```

```{python echo=TRUE}
# Initialize trust score.
trust_model = trustscore.TrustScore()

trust_model.fit(X_penguins, y_penguins)
# SARAH: ValueError: at least one array or dtype is required

```

```{r}
py_last_error()
```

```{python}

# Compute trusts score, given (unlabeled) testing examples and (hard) model predictions.
trust_score = trust_model.get_score(X_penguins, y_pred)

print(trust_score) # prints the trust scores for each point in the inputted dataset

# type(trust_score) # this trust_score data frame has a class of <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
